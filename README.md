## OdinBook

OdinBook is a social media platform that allows users to create posts, comment on posts, and like posts. Users can also follow other users and view their followers posts. OdinBook was built using Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL for the backend, based on [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-rails-final-project)
